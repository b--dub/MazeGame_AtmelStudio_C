Maze Game for Arduino using shift registers, accelerometer and RED 8x8 LED Matrix

Arduino powered maze game with 2x 595 8 bit Shift Registers, a GY-61 5 pin 3 axis accelerometer, and 8x8 LED matrix.  
I may end up adding some sound later with a piezo transducer if I don't get sidetracked onto another project first.  :)
