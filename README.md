Maze Game for Arduino using shift registers, accelerometer and RED 8x8 LED Matrix

Arduino powered Maze Game with 2x 595 8 bit Shift Registers chained together to control Rows and Columns of a single colort 8x8 LED Matrix.  A GY-61 5 pin 3 axis accelerometer is used to control the direction and speed of the player on the display.  I may end up adding some sound later with a piezo transducer if I don't get sidetracked onto another project first.  :)
